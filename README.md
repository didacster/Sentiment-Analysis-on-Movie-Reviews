# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews 

This project performs multi-class sentiment analysis on movie review phrases using deep learning techniques. It is based on the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews), which provides a dataset of short phrases from Rotten Tomatoes reviews labeled with fine-grained sentiment (from very negative to very positive).

The goal is to classify each phrase into one of five sentiment categories using a custom-built model in TensorFlow.
